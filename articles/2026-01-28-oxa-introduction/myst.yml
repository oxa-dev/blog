  title: Introducing the Open Exchange Architecture
  description: |
    Scientific communication still privileges narrative over utility, while the data, code,
    protocols, and computation that underpin modern research are pushed into
    hard-to-access supplements. Rowan Cockett introduces the
    Open Exchange Architecture (OXA), an emerging, community-driven standard
    designed to unbundle research from its paper-shaped container and expose
    the rich evidence underneath it.
